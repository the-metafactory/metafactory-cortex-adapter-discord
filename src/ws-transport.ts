/**
 * WebSocket transport bootstrap — force `@discordjs/ws` onto the robust `ws`
 * package on Bun.
 *
 * cortex#1797 (S12 MOVE) — relocated verbatim from cortex core
 * (`src/bootstrap/ws-transport.ts`). The discord extraction pulled `discord.js`
 * (and its `@discordjs/ws` transport) out of cortex's own `package.json`, so
 * this shim — whose entire job is to fix `@discordjs/ws`'s Bun transport — now
 * lives with the code it protects, in the Discord bundle. `installWsTransport()`
 * and its behaviour are byte-identical to the pre-move cortex version.
 *
 * Root cause (cortex#546/#581/#590/#591/#593 — the recurring
 * `ClientConnectionResetError … Attempting a reconnect` flapping, same class
 * as the 2026-05-09 8.4h outage): `@discordjs/util`'s
 * `shouldUseGlobalFetchAndWebSocket()` keys on `"bun" in process.versions`,
 * so on Bun it returns true and `@discordjs/ws` binds
 *
 *   WebSocketConstructor = shouldUseGlobalFetchAndWebSocket()
 *     ? globalThis.WebSocket        // ← Bun's native WebSocket (drops: "Connection ended")
 *     : import_ws.WebSocket;        // ← the battle-tested `ws` package (a hard dep, installed, unused)
 *
 * (`@discordjs/ws/dist/index.js:602`). discord.js on Node always uses `ws`;
 * only Bun/Deno opt into native. We restore the Node-tested transport by
 * overriding `globalThis.WebSocket` with the `ws` implementation BEFORE
 * `@discordjs/ws` evaluates that module-level constructor.
 *
 * Placement contract: this module MUST be imported before any transitive
 * `discord.js` import. The bundle's entry module is `plugin.ts`, which imports
 * this module on its FIRST import line — before `import { DiscordAdapter } from
 * "./index"` (the subtree that pulls `discord.js`/`@discordjs/ws`). cortex runs
 * UNBUNDLED from source under Bun (`~/.local/bin/cortex` → `src/cortex.ts`, which
 * loads this bundle via the adapter loader's `import()`), so there is no
 * tree-shake/bundle step to defeat the override — being the first import of the
 * plugin entry module is sufficient. ESM evaluates imported modules depth-first
 * in source order, so `import "./ws-transport"` at the top of `plugin.ts` runs
 * its side effect before the `discord.js` subtree is evaluated, and the plugin
 * module itself is fully evaluated at `import()` time — before `createAdapter`
 * ever constructs a `DiscordAdapter`/`Client`. This preserves the exact ordering
 * guarantee the pre-move `cortex.ts` line-1 import provided (it ran at cortex
 * boot before any Discord client connected).
 *
 * Scope: Bun only. On Node `shouldUseGlobalFetchAndWebSocket()` is already
 * false (so @discordjs/ws uses `ws` regardless) and we leave the global
 * untouched. Opt-out via `CORTEX_WS_NATIVE=1` to A/B against Bun's native
 * transport while validating this fix.
