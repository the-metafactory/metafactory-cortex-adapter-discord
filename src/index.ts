   *     2. Pass 2: setTrustedBotIds(merged) on each adapter
   *     3. Pass 2 (continued): attachInboundDispatch() on each adapter
   *

   * cortex#120 — Find or create a public thread by name on a parent text
   * channel. Used by the inbound auto-thread path: when a message in a
   * CHANNEL matches the review wire format, route the agent's reply into
   * the per-PR thread `{repo}/pr/<N>` instead of the channel.
   *
   * Distinct from `createThread` (which always creates a NEW thread
   * attached to a specific message via `msg.startThread`):
   *
   *   - `createThread(msg, name)` — message-anchored, used by async/team
   *      dispatch paths that always create a fresh per-task thread
   *   - `findOrCreateThreadByName(parentChannelId, name)` — channel-
   *      anchored, idempotent. First call creates; subsequent calls reuse
   *      the existing thread. The right primitive for `{repo}/pr/<N>`
   *      threads which must collapse to one regardless of how many review
   *      requests land in the channel.
   *
   * Lookup strategy: `channel.threads.fetchActive()` lists currently
   * non-archived threads. Discord's API distinguishes active vs archived
   * — once a thread auto-archives after 24h of inactivity it's no longer
   * in this list. We accept that: any inbound review ping inside the
   * 24h window reuses the active thread; one that lands after archive
   * creates a fresh thread. The alternative (also list archived via
   * `fetchArchived`) is slower and rarely worth it for per-PR work
   * windows that close in hours.
   *
   * Failure modes: if `client.channels.fetch` returns a non-text
   * channel, or the parent doesn't support threads, returns `null`.
   * Callers fall back to channel-level reply.
